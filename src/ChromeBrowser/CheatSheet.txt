    waits
    (listen to the DOM)

    implicit wait
            driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
    Pro: code is clean
    Con: makes all slaw, maybe masks performace issue
    explicit wait
            WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, 5);
            wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.id("results")));
    Pro: specific to elements
    Con: doesn't cover flaky sites
    fluent explicit wait
    checks DOM at regular intervalls and doesn't listen permanently (x sec)
    e.g. first message apears at 3sec, second message appears at 7 sec -> want to check both and then move forward -> interval to 4sec
        fluent wait + explicit wait are different classes, which implements the wait interface
